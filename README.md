# Shrek (GBA) TAS tools
Tools to help with [TASing](https://tasvideos.org/) the Shrek series for Game Boy Advance. This is specifically focused on the series developed by Vicarious Visions.

Currently, this is only the position-display script for Shrek 2 (GBA). It displays the position and speed for each player character in the level, along with a few other pieces of information

`retro_tas.lua` is copied from https://github.com/RetroEdit/retro_tas -- it should probably be a submodule, but I don't feel like setting that up right now.
